Hello,

friends.

And welcome to Tutorials point.

Today we're gonna talk about structuring your presentation.

So when it comes to presentation,

what are the key elements that one needs to keep in mind to structure the content?

So what is a presentation structure?

What role does the introduction play over here when it comes to main point the

body of the presentation?

What is that?

We need to remember the role of transitions and presentation

and the impact one should have when you're closing the presentation and at

the end,

we'll do a conclusion on this topic presentation

structure.

So whenever you're doing a structure,

it has to be very straightforward and logical.

Any presentation that you do,

it has to have these three elements.

First is the introduction.

The introduction has to be very informative.

Second,

when it comes to the main points,

whatever that you step in,

it has to be in a very logical way.

And every presentation should have a conclusion aspect.

And this conclusion should be very purposeful.

So let's talk about these aspects more in detail. 

The introduction that is the beginning.

Every time you do the introduction,

it has to be an introduction of yourself and also the topic.

The main purpose for doing the introduction is to set up the context for the

entire delivery of your topic.

What are the objectives?

What does that you want your audience to know about?

What does that you want your audience to do?

Post the delivery of the presentation.

And what is that you want them to think upon or conclude upon?

Now, when you do an introduction,

you also need to keep in mind that you should always start with a positive aspect.

You could either start with an icebreaker or with some activity,

or you can also start with the storytelling.

This creates an impact and also helps you to build rap up with your

audience when it comes to the main body to

ask yourself these two questions,

What am I really telling them?

What should they be learning from your When you ask these two questions,

you immediately get an answer as to how your structure should be,

and you also know whether whatever context that you're setting is it

correct,

or do you need to tweak it a little bit,

or do you need to have some more videos audios or some data and facts to

make it more interesting.

Your play.

This plays an important role in prioritising in focusing

and sequencing your information.

Going forward transitions,

transition play an important role when it comes to the structuring of presentation,

the Transition Act also as a slight separator,

where we also tell the audiences as to where we have come and

where is that we have to go.

So where are we?

So this plays a very important role.

Secondly,

it also helps to connect with the topic.

Third,

there are not verbal transitions,

also that you can do like pausing,

changing of slides or focusing on a certain group of

people.

So these are the non verbal transitions or cues that one can use

The closing The closing is very important because we are bringing to an

end of the presentation here.

One needs to summarise the entire topic that has been delivered.

There are also certain elements one need to keep in mind,

like a review of the topic and the purpose of your

presentation so you can again highlight or bring to the audience's notice as

to how did we start?

And finally we've come to an end.

Secondly,

a statement of the conclusion is very important,

like a summarising third,

an indication of next stages.

So are there any action levels for the audience?

Do you want the audience to think over it and come back to you?

What is that you want the audience to do and

instructed as to what happens?

That is what's next last a thank you to the

audience for their attention.

Getting a conclusion on this topic having an introduction and conclusion is

must,

because at the starting of the topic,

when you introduce you set up a purpose and when you conclude you bring a closure for the

entire presentation,

that's all in this topic.
