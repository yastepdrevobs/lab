This is a script, that finds pairs of two walues, that sum equiwals to 10.
I use random to chaoticly fill the array.
Its wery easy, but I forgot to make loop, so you should manually reload the program.
Also i wanted to do manual input of array, but i not qite understood how to do it easy to use.

So it is my lab3, and also lab2 because of README file.
